# 1980s-CMOS-sentaurus-Fabrication
This project is a s-process (sentaurus simulation tool) code for the fabrication process of the 1980s CMOS with the 250nm technology node, the 1980s CMOS structure was obtained from the reference Silicon VLSI Technology: Fundamentals, Practice and Modeling [Plummer, James D., Deal, Michael, Griffin, Peter B.] .
The code is a simulation code on sentaurus simulation tool( s-process ), upon running the code and visualizing (s-visual ) the fabrication process step by step shall be simulated .
The parameters used are as follows:
Channel length = 250 nm
Oxide thickness = 4.8 nm
Junction Depth = 80 nm
Channel Doping = 7e+17
Epitaxial layer Doping = 6e+16
Substrate Doping = 8.4 e+17
